          #   `SUSPECTED_FRAUD` state.

          #
          # - `FIRST_PARTY_FRAUD`: First-party fraud occurs when a legitimate account or
          #   cardholder intentionally misuses financial services for personal gain. This
          #   includes actions such as disputing legitimate transactions to obtain a refund,
          #   abusing return policies, or defaulting on credit obligations without intent to
          #   repay.
          # - `ACCOUNT_TAKEOVER`: Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
          #   unauthorized access to an existing account, modifies account settings, and
          #   carries out fraudulent transactions.
          # - `CARD_COMPROMISED`: Card compromised fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
          #   access to card details without taking over the account, such as through
          #   physical card theft, cloning, or online data breaches.
          # - `IDENTITY_THEFT`: Identity theft fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen
          #   personal information, such as Social Security numbers or addresses, to open
          #   accounts, apply for loans, or conduct financial transactions in someone's
          #   name.
          # - `CARDHOLDER_MANIPULATION`: This type of fraud occurs when a fraudster
          #   manipulates or coerces a legitimate cardholder into unauthorized transactions,
          #   often through social engineering tactics.
